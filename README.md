# REAL-OR-FAKE-JOB-POSTING-PREDICTION
The dataset contains 18K job descriptions out of which about 800 are fake. The data consists of both textual information and meta-information about the jobs.
The objective is to create a classification model that uses text data features and meta-features and predict which job description are fraudulent or real.
Steps to be followed:
1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Load the dataset
3. Removing null values
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Splitting dataset into training and testing
6. Creating a model
7. Training the model
8. Evaluate the model
9. Classification report
10. Prediction on unknown job description

This project is done using NLP and Deep Learning.
